<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Water Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Water Sensors</li><li>Non-contacting Water Sensors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Contact water sensors come into direct contact with the water to measure levels, typically using probes or electrodes. They are commonly used in applications such as wastewater treatment plants. Non-contacting water sensors, on the other hand, do not physically touch the water but instead use technologies such as ultrasonic waves or infrared light to detect water levels. These sensors are often preferred in sensitive or harsh environments where direct contact may not be feasible or safe.</p></p>
