<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Drag Chain Conveyor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Standard Drag Chain Conveyors</li><li>En-masse Drag Chain Conveyors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Drag chain conveyors are a type of mechanical conveying system used to move bulk materials horizontally or on a slight incline. There are two main types in the market - Standard Drag Chain Conveyors and En-masse Drag Chain Conveyors. Standard drag chain conveyors utilize individual conveyor links connected by a chain to move materials. En-masse drag chain conveyors use a single continuous chain and feature a higher capacity for moving heavy bulk materials. Both types are commonly used in industries such as mining, agriculture, and recycling.</p></p>
