<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Base Isolation System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Elastomeric Isolator</li><li>Sliding Isolator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Base isolation system is a crucial technology used to protect structures from seismic vibrations. There are two main types of base isolation systems: elastomeric isolators and sliding isolators. Elastomeric isolators are made of rubber-like materials that absorb and dissipate seismic energy, while sliding isolators allow the structure to slide horizontally during an earthquake, reducing the impact of ground motion. Both types of systems help to reduce structural damage and ensure the safety of buildings and their occupants during seismic events.</p></p>
