<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Security Radar Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Imaging Radars Sensors</li><li>Non-Imaging Radars Sensors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Imaging radars sensors capture high-resolution images of the surroundings using radio waves, providing detailed information about objects' size, shape, and movement. Non-imaging radars sensors, on the other hand, detect the presence and location of objects without producing images, focusing on identifying potential threats based on movement patterns and distances. Both types of radar sensors play a crucial role in enhancing security systems by enabling early detection of intruders or suspicious activities within a specified area, allowing for timely response and threat mitigation.</p></p>
